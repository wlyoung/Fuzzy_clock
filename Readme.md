Arduino powered LED 'Fuzzy Clock'
=================================


CNc-cut acrylic clock with wooden base, that uses an [Adafruit 30 led digital strip][strip] and [Sparkfun Arduino ProMini][Arduino] to indicate the passage of time by varying the color and intensity of the LED under each number. It requires the [Adafruit Neopixel library][library] and is based on their examples files. The 'fuzzy_clock' Arduino sketch is licensed under the same GPL license as the Adafruit files and is contained in the 'copying' file.


The clock numbers are cut from a piece of 0.5" thick acrylic that's 16" long by 3" high, with a 90 degree v-bit. The wooden base uses a .75" thick piece that's 17.75" long by 2.75" wide. The base is cut on both sides so must be flipped...a fence and holding jig helps maintain alignment. You'll also need a [5 volt power supply][Power] and a [female DC plug adaptor][plug] to match. 

The project includes:

- a 'VCarvePro for ShopBot' file for carving the numbers in 1/2" acrylic
- a 'VCarvePro for ShopBot' file for the top of the wooden base
- a 'VCarvePro for ShopBot' file for the bottom of the wooden Base
- ShopBot part files for each
- Arduino sketch
- Adafruit library for LED strip
